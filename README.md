# git_HandsOn
This repository has been created to practice GitHub HandsOn.

It contains the three documents that have been introduced during the work. These include:
- seqClass.py: Is a script which allows us to recognise whether a sequence is DNA or RNA and if is a motif or not. 
- percentage.py: Is a script that shows the nucleotide percentatges of a DNA or RNA sequence.
